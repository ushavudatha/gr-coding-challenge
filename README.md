Instructions to build and run the solution:

Code File name: getstats.py
    code file has variables owner and repo, for now I have assigned 'calcom' and 'cal.com' respectively. can change these values to desired input to generate the stats of teams against a single repository.

output: output.csv


command to run code file: python3 getstats.py
Dependencies: 
    Python3 [Language Used]
    requests [to process API requests]
    mplcursors [incase of plotting] {optional}
    matplotlib.pyplot as plt [incase of plotting] {optional}
    csv [to write into csv files]

Can use python to generate plots using 'output.csv' file.

Might have used Javascript to develop an interactive dashboard but due to time constraint, Used Tableau for charts to develop a report indicating productivity {'gresearch.twb' in the repo}.
