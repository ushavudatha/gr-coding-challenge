# gr-coding-challenge

## Description
This project is designed to gather various statistics related to contributors on a single GitHub repository, such as commits, additions, deletions, pull requests, issues created and closed, and review comments. It also provides an option to plot the data using matplotlib and mplcursors, and outputs the data to a CSV file.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies: requests, matplotlib, mplcursors, and csv.
3. Update the owner and repo variables in **getstats.py** to match the desired repository.
4. Run **getstats.py** using the command **python3 getstats.py**.

## Usage
After running **getstats.py**, a CSV file named **output.csv** will be generated in the same directory. This file contains all the statistics gathered for each contributor.

If desired, matplotlib and mplcursors can be used to create interactive plots of the data.
